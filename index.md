## ClockWise 2.20a


# Version update:

Interface polished, automation improvements, new miniaturised view, ability to detect (and terminate) internet connection on schedule, various enhancements, more options, more customisation and bug fixes.
Summary:  Clockwise is described as "….an alarm clock for your PC – and more". A bit of understatement considering that you can schedule any program to run unattended, as well as use a variety of timing tools such as countdown timer, stopwatch and alarms, and a simple to use calendar.

What you get:  A clock, calendar, timer, stopwatch, five alarms, 'sticky-note' reminders and a program scheduler. The display also shows various time zones, local sunrise and sunset information, and can automatically update your system clock. The most useful feature would depend on the person using it, but we were most impressed by the scheduling features, which allow you to program up to thirty events to run completely automatically, such as virus scanning, disk scanning, backup procedures, even rebooting or shutting down your system. All of which is remarkably simple to setup.

Setup and installation:  Simple and user-friendly; the procedure leads you through step by step.

# Ease of use: 

Most impressive, especially considering the number of features in such a small program. This is a program that within a very small time you’ll be using fully - probably without even having to look at the online help.

# Help & support: 

Simple and well-explained, although very little is actually necessary.

# Technical bit: 

On average the software used-up less than 1 MB of RAM, and between 5 and 7% of the system resources - in short, very little. Even on quite a low powered machine, you really shouldn't feel the effect of this program sitting in the system tray.

# Problems: 

During the testing, we found a couple of very minor problems; all of which the author has assured us will be fixed in the next version.

# Verdict: 

The software is most notable for it's ease of use, number of features, low demand on system resources and very low price. All of which add up to a fine program that many people could find to be extremely useful.
